# CVE-2019-11447 reverse shell upload 

Exploit for CuteNews 2.1.2.

A slightly modified version of the [ColdFusionX POC](https://github.com/ColdFusionX/CVE-2019-11447_CuteNews-AvatarUploadRCE) which spawns a full reverse shell rather than a web shell.

This exploit uses the famous [PentestMonkey PHP Reverse Shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell).

## Example use:

* Create a user on the application
* Run the following
`python exploit.py http://{target}/index.php {myuser} {mypassword}`
* Open a listener and navigate to the path listed by the exploit.
